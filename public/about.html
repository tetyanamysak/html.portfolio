<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tanja and I currently work as a supervisor for bakery store. I really enjoy working in
  a bakery setting and am looking to expand my baking experience and learn more about other
  pastries. One of my dreams is to have a bakery of my own one day</p>

<p>A few of the things I do at my current job include baking cookies and making frosting. I also train
  any new hires and make sure everything in the store is stocked and cleaned. I am able to do
  what is required for opening and closing the store, as some days I open the store and some
  days I close the store. I make sure that the store looks great every time a customer walks in.</p>

<p>I really enjoy interacting with customers and helping them choose the perfect dessert that I
  know they will love!</p>
